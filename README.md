This is my first personal website! 
Started with a static code with all sizing in pixels and floating blocks.  
Then I learned responsive coding and added flexbox making my site look great on a phone and a desktop computer.
This site is still under construction and probably always will be.  As learn new skills I keep updating and tweaking. 

Finished styling text for mobile phone screen size.  Changed out all .png icons for Fontawesome icons.  Also made all links in Contact section ul-lists.  This is way easier for consistant styling.  Also moved some of the base styles I had in place for ul,ol to the header section.  I am still learning when to make a style general and when to make it more specific.  I don't want to be sloppy and just rewrite over previous CSS styling.
